__Step 2 :__ Open the program Code (i.e The Program code available in Firmware Folder) in Arduino IDE

__Step 3 :__ Generate .hex File (i.e. HEX file ) in Arduino IDE and copy the location Where it has been generated (You can also genterate the HEX file by Pressing __Ctrl+Alt+S__ )

__Step 4 :__ Open Proteus and Click on the Arduino UNO board there you can find section called __Program File__ paste the location of the generated hex file (or You can open the hex file where it is available in same folder where your project .ino  file is )

__Step 5 :__ __Run__ the Simulation
